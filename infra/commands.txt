  kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard port-forward svc/kubernetes-dashboard-kong-proxy 8443:443

NOTE: In case port-forward command does not work, make sure that kong service name is correct.
    Check the services in Kubernetes Dashboard namespace using:
      kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get svc

kubectl get secret admin-user -n kubernetes-dashboard -o jsonpath={".data.token"} | base64 -d
